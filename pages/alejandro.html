           In an interview, Gaga said that each of her songs written for The Fame Monster were all influenced by a monster. The monsters all take place in each song; for example, "Alejandro" was influenced by her "Fear of Men Monster". She confirmed this monster in an interview On the Record with Fuse. In the song, 'Alejandro' represents Alexander McQueen, 'Fernando' represents Fernando Garibay, one of the producers she worked with on the album and for The Monster Ball Tour, and 'Roberto' represents Rob Fusari, an old producer and ex-boyfriend. The lyrics talk about Gaga defending herself against a "harem" of Latin men and has a number of ABBA allusions, including a reference to their 1976 song "Fernando", which Gaga cited as one of her influences.
