           This song I wrote right after I left Berlin. I went to the Lab.Oratory Club [May 11, 2010] the night before, I had some fun with my friends then the next day I wrote 'Schei√üe'. I meant it like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy.
