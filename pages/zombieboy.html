           I think that Rick [Genest] just was an inspiring person. And when I was working on this song, which is ultimately a big celebration song, that word just popped into my head. And that song is all about the moment in the night when you and your friends all realize that you’re going to wake up not feeling well the next day because you’re having too much fun, so it’s about being a zombie in the morning.
