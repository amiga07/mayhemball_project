        I worked on Shallow with Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt and Anthony Rossomando and we made this song for Ally and Jack and it’s such a special song. It’s two people talking to each other about the need and the drive to dive into the deep end and stay away from the shallow area. We were writing 'Shallow' from the point of view of Ally, it becomes part of the reason they fall in love. When I was writing music for the film I had to think about Ally as if she wasn't me. I went with a sound for her, even in the pop realm, that's unlike anything I've ever put out before.
