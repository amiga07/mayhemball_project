            "Aura" is, the first experience that you have on the [ ARTPOP ] app. (...) So, I guess I wrote this song, as a way to sort of accompany, that initial experience. (...) So, this is really a song that is about a lot of different things, but what it is really, is that people have a certain perception of me, because I wear a lot of very visual fashion, and I’m a very creative person. So, this song is about me basically saying, that just because all of those things are there that doesn’t mean there’s not, sort of the same person underneath; and then also that, these veils are just protecting me from the thing that I hold most sacred: which is my creativity. And so it’s really, my aura, is the way that I deal with my insanity — and I feel quite insane — so, the song sounds quite insane. It’s a complextual record that I did with DJ Zedd and Infected Mushroom, and there’s sort of this Israeli guitar, that’s looping in and out of this, really complex beat; and you know, I’m kind of a complex personality, very intense personality. So, this song is both of those things. One of the lyrics is, [lyrics from "Aura"] “Enigma pop star is fun, she wear burqa for fashion / It’s not a statement as much as just a move of passion,” you know, everyone thinks everything I do is a statement, but sometimes I’m just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.
