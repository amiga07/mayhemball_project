           I just thought that it was turning into a constant problem, so what's more important thing to write about than the absolute hugest part of media culture? The paparazzi. What am I really trying to say here? What will the act of me writing this song really do? Me making a conscious decision to write about the paparazzi – I thought about performance art and shock art and how Paris Hilton and her sister and Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie are shock artists in their own way. They're not necessarily doing fine arts – something they put in the museums – but it's an art form. That's what this song is trying to say. [...] At the same time, the lyrics are very confusing. It says, "I'm your biggest fan. I'll follow you until you love me, paparazzi. There's no other superstar you know that I'll be. Your Papa-paparazzi." The thing is, I will chase you because I'm a star but I'm going to chase you if you're the star. It's very twisted. When you have love, when you have fame, when you have both, it's all of those issues in one record. It's my favorite song in the album. [...] Well I'm so glad there are a few different interpretations, that was the idea. The song is about a few different things – it's about my struggles, do I want fame or do I want love? It's also about wooing the paparazzi to fall in love with me. It's about the media whoring, if you will, watching ersatz make fools of themselves to their station. It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can you only have one?
