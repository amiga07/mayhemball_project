            After a concert in Russia, Lady Gaga was in Norway and got the inspiration to write "Bad Romance". A demo of the song was recorded in Amsterdam with RedOne, this version has less vocal tracks, and has a different beat at tshe intro and has been changed slightly in the chorus. Towards three quarters into the song, the French verse of the album version is replaced with "I want your love and I want your revenge. I want your love I donâ€™t wanna be friends". The lyrics in general, talk about exploring the joys of a bad romance but this idea changes during the intermediate bridge when the lyrics talk about fashion. While being interviewed on the November 2, 2009 episode of It's On with Alexa Chung, Gaga pointed out that she was listing Alfred Hitchcock films (Psycho, Vertigo, and Rear Window) in the verse, "I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick / Want you in my rear window, baby you're sick." She stated, "What I'm really trying to say is I want the deepest, darkest, sickest parts of you that you are afraid to share with anyone because I love you that much. Along with the rest of the songs from The Fame Monster, "Bad Romance" deals with a monster. This song represents her "Fear of Love Monster".
