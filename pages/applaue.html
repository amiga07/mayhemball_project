        <q>
           I never choose my singles, so I didn't actually choose it. But I thought it was a great choice as a lead single because the album is very eclectic and it goes on a journey, so it was more about what was the first statement that we wanted to make and I liked the statement that it made because it brings back some very old sentiments about show business that I feel are very very absent right now. This idea that the performer lives for the applause as opposed to living for the fame separate from the stage. I don't care about that kind of fame. Just having people's attention all the time what I crave is performing live and making a connection with my fans and hearing them cheer because they're happy.
