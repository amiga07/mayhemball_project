           Lady Gaga wanted to write a song her boyfriend would like, forming the main idea behind the song being about bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to her rock 'n' roll boyfriends. Lyrically "Poker Face" is about sex and gambling. Gaga was inspired by her days as a New York City go-go dancer, and is one of her favorite songs of the album. The term, "Poker Face", represents the tricks she used to fool man, and sometimes woman that she was into them, so they would throw money at her. There is also an ambiguous part with "He's got me like nobody" and "She's got me like nobody" in the chorus, which caused some undertone of confusion about love and sex. According to BBC, the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook used in the song is copied from Boney M's 1977 (jobs) hit, "Ma Baker". When RLT Boulevard asked Gaga about the hook, she replied: "I love Boney M so perhaps subconsciously it came out in the song". During Rango Tanga, Lady Gaga admitted that Kiss FM was the only radio station to correctly censor the song during the chorus when she replaces "poker face" with "fuck her face". Although not in the official lyrics, the switch can be heard every second repetition of the phrase during the chorus. Some TV channels have also censored it.
